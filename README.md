# Income Classifier
This project is based on the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/lodetomasi1995/income-classification).

# Objective
To develop a classifier that classify instances into 2 classes, 1) individuals earning more than 50K, 2) individuals earning less than 50K a year.
 
# Overview of Solution
1a) Train a base model - Decision Tree

1b) Fine-tune the base model using Grid Search

2a) Train an alternative model - Random Forest

2b) Fine-tune the alternative model using Grid Search 

3a) Compare if the complex model (Random Forest) perform significantly better than the Decision Tree model

# Performance Metrics
Models will be evaluated based on their F1 score
